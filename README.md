**Homework 5: Work Day Scheduler**

**Description**

Create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

You'll need to use the [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) library to work with date and time. Be sure to read the documentation carefully and concentrate on using Moment.js in the browser.

**Tasks Completed**
1. I was able to display current date in time.
2. Created multiple rows for each hour. 
3. Each row has a responsive text area that will allow user to enter data/text. 
4. Responsive save button added to the row to save data/text to local storage. 
5. Created local storage to each row that data/text is entered and is display in local storage file in developer tools.
